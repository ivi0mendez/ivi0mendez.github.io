	<p> WHY I LOVE LEAGUE OF LEGENDS?</P>
	<P>The simple reason is because is a roll game which i can play as a magician, killer, or in case a support. This game came to my life when i was in 3Â° of secondary school, first i play with a "champion" named Jinx, but that was not my main character  but i met Ashe and that was my favourite character in all the times, i am not the best player but i like the feelings when i compite against others.</P>
		<P> What is League of Legends?</p>
<p>League of Legends is a frenetic, competitive online game that fuses the speed and intensity of real-time strategy (ETR) with elements of RPGs. Two teams of powerful champions, each with a unique design and game style, compete face-to-face across various battlefields and game modes. With an ever-expanding roster of champions, frequent updates and an exciting competitive landscape, League of Legends offers unlimited gaming possibilities for users of all skill levels.</P>

	ASHE: With each arrow from her enchanted bow with ancient ice, Ashe proves that she is an archera master. Choose your target with extreme care, wait for the right moment and then attack with power and precision. With this same perspective and concentration he pursues his goal of uniting the tribes of Freljord to forge a powerful nation.</p>

	<p>Ekko, a prodigy emerging from the implacable streets of Zaun, manipulates the time to take advantage of all the situations. With a machine of his invention called Device Z, he explores the different possibilities of reality and elaborates the perfect moment. Although he loves his freedom, if he threatens his friends, he will do anything to defend them. For those who do not know who this boy really is, he seems to get the impossible at first, again and again.
	</p>
	<p> TALIYAH</p>
	<p> It's tough being different, and Taliyah's earth-shattering powers have always set her apart from the crowd. She's a control mage who weaves the ground beneath her into a deadly weapon; when she sets her sights on a destination, the world itsefl shifts to get her here.</p>

	<p> Half the season is just around the corner and the balance adjustments will require more than one upgrade, so take this version as a start-up. Having said that, we are going to focus on the changes needed at this time and on those that will bear fruit later on.

First, let's take the opportunity to study how latency affects the gaming experience. Obviously, nobody likes to play with a lot of latency, but some champions are more affected. We will implement some quality changes of the experience to make those champions suffer less consequences when the answer is not as fast as it should be.</p><img src="http://orig04.deviantart.net/e35d/f/2017/095/f/7/xayah_and_rakan_dock_icon_by_outlawninja-db4tsos.png"</div>

<p>Converted into a living weapon designed to operate outside the law, it is an elegant elite agent who makes sure nothing threatens the Piltover machinery and its vulnerable zaunite flank. Camille's real strength lies in her adaptability and in a meticulousness that makes her see the negligence in the execution as a vice that must be addressed. Raised in a world of wealth and good manners, she is the spy chief of the Ferros clan and is responsible for surgical removal of the darkest problems of the family. Endowed with a mind as sharp as the leaves she wields, she has undertaken a quest for perfection through the hextech enhancements she has undergone, improvements that have led many to wonder whether it will be more machine than woman.</p>
<P> HOW TO PLAY?</P>
		<P>Champions:</P>
<P>The League has several archetypes of champions, from evil criminal minds to monstrous and epic creatures, going through all sorts of characters you can imagine. The different champions cover different positions and strategies, so do not be discouraged if your first choice does not fit your style of play.
</P>
		<P>Rails</P>
<P>There are three ways that connect your base with that of the enemy. These paths are called lanes and serve to confront the enemy team. To conquer you will have to advance the lane to the enemy base and destroy the nexus that is in the center of its base.</P>
